    "Given a review, determine whether the review is positive (Rating of 4 or 5) or negative (rating of 1 or 2).\n",

    "[Q] How to determine if a review is positive or negative?\n",
    "\n",
    "[Ans] We could use the Score/Rating. A rating of 4 or 5 could be cosnidered a positive review. A review of 1 or 2 could be considered negative. A review of 3 is nuetral and ignored. This is an approximate and proxy way of determining the polarity (positivity/negativity) of a review."
