    "The Amazon Fine Food Reviews dataset consists of reviews of fine foods from Amazon.<br>\n",

    "Number of reviews: 568,454<br>\n",
    "Number of users: 256,059<br>\n",

    "1. Id\n",
    "2. ProductId - unique identifier for the product\n",
    "3. UserId - unqiue identifier for the user\n",
    "4. ProfileName\n",
    "5. HelpfulnessNumerator - number of users who found the review helpful\n",
    "6. HelpfulnessDenominator - number of users who indicated whether they found the review helpful or not\n",
    "7. Score - rating between 1 and 5\n",

    "### Objective:\n",
    "Given a review, determine whether the review is positive (Rating of 4 or 5) or negative (rating of 1 or 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ques.** How to determine if a review is positive or negative?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans.** \n",
    "1. If we simply use the score/rating column, the problem becomes very trivial and a simple if-else condition is enough to find out the polarity of a given review.<br>\n",
    "2. To turn this problem into a machine learning problem, we remove the score column and use the reviews column and convert reviews to d-dimensional vectors.<br>\n",
    "3. We apply the concepts of linear algebra along with some machine learning algorithms on these vectors and find out the polarity of each review.<br>\n",
    "4. A rating of 4 or 5 could be considered a positive. A rating of 1 or 2 could be considered negative. A review with rating 3 is considered neutral and ignored. This is an approximate and proxy way of determining the polarity (positivity/negativity) of a review."
